# Allison Crank

Allison Crank is a designer and researcher working between architecture, immersive technology, and intelligent systems.

Born in the United States, she studied architecture at [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/) and [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/). She later earned graduate degrees from the **Design Academy Eindhoven** (MA Contextual Design, *cum laude*) and **EPFL** (MSc Design for Digital Innovation) in Lausanne, Switzerland. She has lived and worked in the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Denmark, and the United States.

Allison’s work spans mixed reality, AI‑driven interfaces, spatial computing, and narrative systems. She has collaborated with **National Geographic**, **Google**, **Meta**, **MIT Media Lab**, **La Biennale di Venezia**, and **Dreamscape**, creating experiences that explore how people perceive, move, and feel in digital–physical worlds.

Her projects have been presented at the **Venice Film Festival**, **Cannes**, **Tribeca**, and **Annecy**. She was Lead Interaction Designer on **[IMPULSE](https://impulse-xr.io/)**, an Emmy-nominated XR experience about neurodiversity and perception, and her approach to immersive design has been profiled in **[XRMust](https://xrmust.com/xrmagazine/allison-crank-ux-xr-designer/)**.

She has led the design of platforms and systems including  
**LazyBrain** — an emotionally intelligent AI system for creative cognition and neurodiversity  
**[PIX.T](https://trust.pixt.co/)** — a blockchain‑backed platform for photojournalism  
**Polaris** — early research into a community‑driven news environment  
Alongside virtual festivals, museum interactives, AI‑driven creative tools, and spatial interfaces for clients such as **Audemars Piguet**.

Allison is also the founder of **[Crank Studio](https://crank.studio/)**, a Paris‑based practice working across luxury, culture, and care — from mixed‑reality games for neurodiverse teenagers with **[DiverSsiTy](https://diverssity.io/)** to cultural regeneration strategies such as **[Culture Care](https://culture-care.vercel.app/index.html)**.

Previously, she was **Head of Digital Experiences** at [wowl](https://wowl.ch/), designing immersive storytelling for Omega, Rolex, and SWISS, and a **Design Researcher** at the [EPFL+ECAL Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/epflecal-lab/), contributing to the UNESCO‑recognized Montreux Jazz digital archive.

In 2022 she served as **Curator of Raumwelten** — Germany's leading festival for scenography, architecture, and media (11th edition, theme: */imagine*) — directing the programme toward immersion and online social experience in a fully virtual VR Hub format. Her work has also been presented at **SIGGRAPH**, **GDI**, and the **ArtTech Forum**, and published in *Leonardo* (MIT Press). She teaches immersive interaction and worldbuilding at **HSLU**, and at the **Architectural Association Visiting School** in Melbourne, and mentors creators at the Venice VR College at **La Biennale di Venezia**.

She believes design is a form of attention — a way of shaping how people understand and move through complex worlds. She is based in Paris and works internationally.
